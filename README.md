# Vehicle-Movement-Based-Street-Light-System


This project aims at designing an automatic street light system which operates at night where the street lamps come to action when a car passes underneath them ( basically movement detected by IR sensors ) and lamps close down when the car passes away.

This project is cost efficient and good for saving electricty.

Here we used the PIC16F72 micro-controller and given are the source code in C language for the working of the micro-controller
